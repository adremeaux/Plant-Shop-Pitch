# About

**Plant Shop** is a game about, well, running your own plant shop! Plant Shop is a game where players raise, hybridize, and sell beautiful plants to interesting customers. Players will breed and manipulate plants with a wide variety of options, put them on display in their store, enter them into competitions with other players, sell them to customers looking for specific features, or raise them for bulk orders.

At the heart of the game is a fantastic piece of technology I've been working on that can generate an enormous number of plants in real time from over 100 different parameters, including leaf shape, veins, color, distortion, and arrangement. With this tool, players can hybridize plants, taking the genetics from both parents and producing offspring that is a variable mix of their parameters. The plants you see in the pictures are 100% generated by code, including all the meshes and textures. I'm very proud of this work! [The plant generator is open source and available on Github](https://github.com/adremeaux/Procedural-Plant-and-Foliage-Generator) and will continue to be maintained as the game is developed.

# Gameplay

Inspired by potion shop games like Atelier and the excellent [No Umbrellas Allowed](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1301390/No_Umbrellas_Allowed/), a customer will enter the shop and ask for a plant with certain features: *I want a plant with long, dark leaves and red veins*. Using plants from their own collection, bought or gifted from markets, or traded with other players, the player can then work on creating a plant to the customer's specifications using tools like DNA editing, mutation-causing chemicals, or in times desperation, even dying or cutting the leaves (which is sure to leave your shop a bad reputation!). The game will present information that will help the player complete their requests successfully, including scores for various categories of plant characteristics. A frog buddy in a sailor suit will be your companion throughout all of this, helping guide you (and making the occassional sarcastic joke).

Players will frequently enter and participate in online competitions with a certain theme: "huge leaves," "stunning veins," or perhaps "unusual shapes." Players will vote on entries from other players and receive rewards for their participation.

Some of the themes I'm focusing on:

* **Stress-Free:** Customers are in no rush! When you get a request, it stays open forever, and there are no penalties for waiting.

* **Accessible** but offering **long term complexity:** I want this game to be playable by a wide variety of people, not just gamers. As you progress down the tech tree, more options will become available to make more complex plants and allow players more control of their output.

* **Gameplay first, with character-driven stories:** There will be a light overarching story in this game, but most of the story will take place in dialog with your customers. The focus is on their stories, not your own. I'm looking to write emotionally honest stories in a light sci-fi setting (think: near-future environmental destruction has people finding solace and calm in beautiful plants).

* **Carrot-on-a-Stick gameplay:** Your capabilities will start off quite low and be developed over time. As you satisfy customer requests, you'll earn money and various tools to help you make more complex and more outlandish plants and better control what you're creating rather than leaving it up to RNG.

* **A little weird:** I'm a little weird. I want the game to be a little weird. We're not Strange Horticulture, but expect unusual customers with silly jokes.

* **Make it look beautiful:** I want players to be able to customize their plants and their shop with a large degree of freedom. Put different stands in different places, change your decor, change the wallpaper, upgrade to different shop layouts, etc.

No P2W microtransactions, minimal cosmetics: I want to build a complete game for a set price.

# Slides

The following are some early slides from interface and gameplay planning.

# Story

The story of the game focuses on the individual. Like some of the best games from the SNES era, rather than focusing on a large overarching plot, individual lives are highlighted. Some of the customers entering the shop will be long term, returning customers, and it is through this lens we learn about their lives. 

Some of the stories will be pretty personal. As an adult diagnosed with autism at 36 years old, I want the stories to highlight journies like mine, through difficulty and achievement, adversity and acceptance.

# Project Status

The plant generator was the major piece of tech for this product and has been built into a beta state with excellent results. Though possible plant variety is still somewhat limited, the tech allows easy expansion, and many new features are planned. These include complex leaf shapes, like in a maple leaf; fenestrations and holes, like in Monstera; compound leaves, like in ferns; vining plants and trailing plants, such as Pothos; and leaf asymmetry, like in Begonias.

A basic gameplay demo is currently in development. The demo will cover the basic gameplay loop: customer request, plant hybridization, delivery, scoring. From here, the gameplay flow and interface design will be iterated, and new gameplay systems will begin to be built. The demo is planned for the end of October, and will be sent to family and friends for initial testing and feedback.

Expected timeline is late 2023 for Early Access, followed by a year of iteration before the 1.0 release. Early Access will allow feedback on gameplay and will focus on bringing new gameplay features to the player and new parameters to the plant generator, increasing plant variety and goal potential.

# Needs

Art! I have an artistic background, including 2D and 3D skills, but making a beautiful interface and quality models for the shop would be better done by a dedicated artist. I will be aiming to hire a graphic designer to work and finesse the interface, and a visionary 3D artist to help build the scene into something rich and alive. Dust motes will drift through the air; a light breeze will blow through the shop, making the plant leaves flutter; during the golden hour, the setting sun will illuminate the plants, luring in customers from the beauty. 

Sound. Music. Music is kitschy, [bossa nova,](https://open.spotify.com/track/7MLxYHd2HMfKigXtFXygYi) almost elevator music. An analog radio on the shop desk lets players change the station to find something they like.
